# The Eastern Roman Empire

Few ever hear about the fate of the eastern roman empire or even its existance. Some hear about the late western name of "the byzantine empire". A slur name for the greek part of the roman empire to deprive it of its roman heritage. Most people do not know the roman empire's last breath was symbolicly taken when the ottoman turks completed their siege of Constantinople 1453. This sites purpose is to enlighten historical enthusiasts with deeper historical exploration of the subject. At the same time entice curiosity in others through short stories and tales of a time long lost to time.

### Notable mistakes
- I have at times used source control to commit messages. And at times I have done so wrongly with inclusion of " git commit - m "message" " instead of just message. After realisation of error I have continued with the correct way of commiting messegaes through the terminal with " git commit - m "message" "
